				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I am trying to edit a generator and also to learn how to use Glitch.com to work on projects and showcase to my portfolio </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Glitch is a online compiler it looks like and is a good way work on projects. We can also host a site through Git as well. Works similar to eachother. The generator 
					uses any paragraph template and combines whats basically a selected array of words over the some of the orginal words in the paragraph. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this myself and had to take a few moments review documentation. Understand the goal and follow submission directions. I did find fun in this 
					generator itself. As it gave me a bit a refresher on javascript, HTML and CSS, but it was fun though at the same time learning the concept of this project.

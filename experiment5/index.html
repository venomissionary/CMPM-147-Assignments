				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>We were trying to get an picked series of 3 images and try to generate a 
				   series of shapes that can resemble them</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We are supposed to intergrate the series of shapes to somewhat form
					into the orginal image. Adding more of the mutation can change the 
					it, but well enough to point that with each generation it's still disguishable. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It was hard for me and my partner at first to understand the goal, 
					however we worked together for this project, which made brain storming on how 
					to go about it faster. 
				</p>

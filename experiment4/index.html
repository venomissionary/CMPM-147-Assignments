				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to make an ocean as my theme for the project. 
					The glistening water just waving down the makes the lillusion. feel organic and alive. 
					There are three versions including dayTime, nightTime, and Sunset.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Taking notes of the slides given as the instructions, i quickly looked at the purpose of the 
					starter files and modify it to pursue a scene that was more so based repeated and interactive events.
					Adding ripples, waves, and making the tiles into gradiant like objects can help make the art look familar to real life oceans and water. 
					messing around the world key can also give diferents seeds of the world.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection </h2>
				<p>For this project i worked on it myself. I think the hardest part of wrapping my head around 
					dynamic art understanding with the files and code present, it took a bit of time of understanding it
					but i think the result is good.</p>
